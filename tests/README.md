# edbo

Experimental Design via Bayesian Optimization

## Testing

This directory contains a number of tests of the basic functionality of *edbo*. Some of the functions test *edbo*'s plotting functions so you will need to close them for test to proceed.

### Running tests

Individual tests can be run using the pytest framework.

```bash
pytest <test>.py
```

### Run all tests

```bash
cd ./edbo/tests
sh tests.sh

# Note: if OS is Linux based you may need to chmod + tests.sh
```
